    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In our project, we simulated a cloth using masses and springs. Our simulation not only includes the cloth but
      also its collision with different objects such as spheres and planes.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and Springs</h2>
    <p>In Part 1, we implemented <i>Cloth::buildGrid</i>, which is meant to create the basis for our cloth. For this
      part, we populated the <i>point_masses</i> vector by looping through the cloth grid in row-major order and storing
      the corresponding <i>PointMass</i> in the vector after converting its index from 2D to 1D. We created the
      corresponding <i>PointMass</i> by setting its position pinned value to true if its position on the grid is in the
      pinned vector and its position according to whether the cloth is horizontal or vertical, its grid position
      relative to the number of points, and the width and height of the grid. Afterwards, we looped through the grid
      again and created the necessary springs for each <i>PointMass</i> using each spring's relative position to the
      <i>PointMass</i>. This includes structures, bending and shearing springs.
    </p>
    <p>As for debugging, during part 2, we realized that the colors for our cloth were different then the ones in the
      spec. We then realized that my implementation for part 1 was in column-major order instead of row-major order.
      After that fix, the colors were correct. Also, in the beginning I didn’t completely understand <i>emblace_back</i>
      so I ran into compilation errors because of incorrect syntax and usage.

    <h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>
    <p>For part 2, we implemented <i>Cloth:simulate</i> which is the physics of the cloth simulation. We computed the
      total force from all of the external accelerations and set them to all of the point masses' forces. We then
      iterated through the springs and calculated the correction forces from the two point masses's magnitude subtracted
      the spring's rest length and multiplied it with the spring constant and added the correction force to a's point
      mass and subtracted it from b's point mass. After this, we iterated through every point mass and updated the
      positions of the unpinned point masses using Verlet integration which takes the current position, adds <i>1 -
        (d/100)</i> where d is the damping factor, multiplies by the difference between the current and last position,
      adds the forces divided by the mass, and multiplies by the timestep squared. We then iterated through the springs
      and corrected the positions of the springs that had the point masses with a distance greater than a 10% change
      from the rest length and the difference from the point masses positions. If the change was greater than 10%, we
      updated the positions of the point masses of the unpinned point masses. To update the position, we multiplied the
      difference in position as a unit vector to the rest length and multiplied the change over 10%. If both point
      masses were unpinned, we divided this by 2 and added this to point mass b and subtracted this to point mass a. If
      only point mass b was unpinned, we added the whole value to point mass b. If only point mass a was unpinned, we
      subtracted the whole value to point mass a.
    </p>
    <p>Changing the spring constant <i>ks</i> changes the amount of ripples after the cloth has finished falling. The
      higher the spring constant, the more stable the cloth becomes. The lower the spring constant, the more ripples and
      instability in the cloth.

    <p>Changing the <i>density</i> value makes the cloth heavier. Increasing the density value will make the cloth hang
      lower and have more ripples in it. Decreasing the density value will make the cloth just hang and be stable.

    <p>Changing the <i>damping</i> value makes the cloth fall at different speeds. A higher damping value leads to the
      cloth falling at a slower rate compared to when the damping value is lower which is when the cloth falls faster.
      This happens because a higher damping value will prevent the other forces taking their full force causing the
      cloth to fall slower. A higher damping value leads to the cloth falling smoother and with less ripples since the
      forces are more uniform compared to when the damping value is lower and the forces act with more ripples and
      variation.

    <h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling Collisions with Other Objects</h2>
    <p>For part 3.1, we implemented <i>Sphere::collide</i>, where we implemented the collision between our cloth and a
      sphere. To do so, we first check to see whether the given point mass of the function is inside the sphere by
      checking to see whether the magnitude between the position of the point mass and the origin of the sphere is less
      than the radius of the sphere. If so, we know a collision has occurred, so we calculate the point at which the
      point mass intersects the surface of the sphere in its trajectory and use that point to determine the amount of
      correction (stated as a vector) needed for the point mass to not go into the sphere. We scale the correction
      vector by <i>1 - friction</i> to get our resulting correction vector and use it to update the point mass with the
      correct position. Afterwards, we go into <i>Cloth::simulate</i> and call the collision function of each object in
      the <i>collision_objects</i> vector on every point mass to make sure object collisions are accounted for in our
      simulations. We didn't really need to debug this function but we did go into office hours to ask if our conceptual
      implementation was correct before implementing 3.1.
    </p>
    <p>For part 3.2, we implemented <i>Plane::collide</i> which is similar to <i>Sphere::collide</i> except this time
      our collision object is a plane. First, we determine whether a collision by finding the point of intersection
      between the trajectory of the given point mass and the plane, finding the difference vector between the last
      position of the point mass and this intersection point, finding the difference vector between the position of the
      point mass and the intersection point, finding the dot product of those differences with the normal vector, and
      comparing the dot products to see whether the difference vectors point in different directions. If they do point
      in different directions, it means that the intersection point is between the position and the last position of the
      point mass and a collision has occurred. Using the intersection point, we find the amount of correction needed to
      move the point mass above the plane offset by <i>SURFACE_OFFSET</i> and then update the position of the point mass
      using the resulting correction vector scaled by <i>1 - friction</i>. We were initially stuck on this part for
      several days since we kept on having an issue where our cloth would go through the plane. However, we resolved
      this when we realized that we were incorrectly detecting whether there was a collision. Once we used the new
      approach with dot products instead, our collision detection worked.

    <h2 align="middle">Part IV: Handling Self-Collisions</h2>
    <p>For part 4.1, we implemented <i>Cloth::hash_position</i> which subdivides the 3D box volume of the cloth into
      smaller 3D boxes (with dimensions as stated in the spec), maps the given point mass's position to its
      corresponding box, and returns a unique float representing the box it's mapped to. We calculate this unique value
      by using the first answer described in <a
        href=“https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1358468/how-to-create-unique-integer-number-from-3-different-integers-numbers1-oracle-l”>this</a>
      article.
    </p>
    <p>For part 4.2, we implemented <i>Cloth::build_spatial_map</i> which populates our unordered map data structure
      <i>map</i> by iterating through every point mass and adding the point mass to the vector which has it's hash
      position (found by calling <i>hash_position</i> as the key.
    </p>
    <p>For part 4.3, we implemented <i>Cloth::self_collide</i>, which detects and reacts to collisions made between the
      folds of the cloth. To do this we first find the hash position of the given point mass and find the corresponding
      vector of point masses associated with the hash position using <i>map</i> in order to find the surrounding point
      masses. With this, we iterate through the point mass vector. We also create a vector which we called <i>final</i>
      initialized to 0s. If the current point mass is not the given point mass and the distance between the current
      point mass and the given point mass is less than 2 times a given thickness, a collision has occurred. We add the
      correction vector (which when added to the current point mass position gives a distance of 2 times the given
      thickness between the given and current point masses) to <i>final</i>. After iterating through the vector of point
      masses, if the number of corrections (which we keep track of in the iterations using an int
      <i>num_corrections</i>) is not zero, we add <i>(final/num_cor) / simulation_steps</i> to the position of our point
      mass.
    </p>
    <p>The final part of 4 is to call these functions. To do so, in <i>Cloth::self_collide</i>, we call
      <i>build_spatial_map</i> and we iterate through the point masses and call <i>self_collide</i> on each one.
    </p>
    <p>As for debugging, in the beginning of testing our self-collision, our cloth was not colliding with itself. We
      discovered that this was because we forgot the last step within 4, where we forgot to call the functions.
      Afterwards, we fixed a few pointer issues in our <i>Cloth::self_collide</i> to get part 4 to work.

    <p>When varying our spring constant, the results are similar to that of part 3. When the spring constant is 500 N/m,
      the cloth almost becomes a stick when it falls onto the plane and then disappears. However, when the spring
      constant is 50,000 N/m, the cloth doesn't seem to bend very much and instead almost looks like a blanket when it's
      at its resting state on the plane. When the density is 5 g/cm^2, the cloth falls slowly and seems more bouncy.
      However, when the density is 30 g/cm^2, the cloth falls more quickly, has many more folds, and seems very flat on
      the plane in its resting state.

    <h2 align="middle">Part V: Shaders</h2>
    <p>For part 5.1, we implemented diffuse shading. We set the <i>out_color</i> to the <i>u_light_intensity / radius ^2
        * max(0 vector, dot(v_normal, vector from u_light_pos to v_position))</i>.
    </p>
    <p>For part 5.2, we implemented blinn phong shading. We used the same code from diffuse shading. We got the max of
      the 0 vector and the dot product of the <i>v_normal</i> and the sum of the vectors from the <i>u_light_pos</i> to
      the <i>v_position</i> and the vector from the <i>u_cam_pos</i> to the <i>v_position</i> divided over the length of
      the sum of those vectors. We took that max and took it to the power of p which we set to 100. We found the
      reflection to be <i> u_light_intensity / radius^2 * max^p</i>. We finally set <i>out_color</i> to <i>0.1 * 1
        vector + kd * diffuse + ks * reflection</i> where <i>ks</i> is set to 0.5 and <i>kd</i> is set to
      <i>u_color</i>.
    </p>
    <p>For part 5.3, we implemented texture mapping. We sampled <i>v_uv</i> using <i></i>u_texture_1</i> and set that to
      the <i>out_color</i>.
    </p>
    <p>For part 5.4.1, we implemented bump mapping. We first got the tangent-bitangent-normal (TBN) matrix by combining
      the vectors <i>v_normal, v_tangent, and the cross product of v_normal and v_tangent</i> into one matrix. We then
      found <i>du = (h(u + 1/w, v) - h(u, v)) * u_height_scaling * u_normal_scaling</i> and <i>dv = (h(u, v + 1/h) -
        h(u, v)) * u_height_scaling * u_normal_scaling</i> where h returns the height encoded by a height map at texture
      coordinates u and v. We then created a vector for local space normal <i>no = -1*du, -1*dv, 1</i>. We then got the
      displaced model space normal vector <i>nd = tbn * no</i>. We then put this normal <i>nd</i> into blinn phong
      shading and set the result to <i>out_color</i>.
    </p>
    <p>For part 5.4.2, we implemented displacement mapping. We copied over the code from bump mapping into the
      <i>displacement.frag</i> file. In the <i>displacement.vert</i> file we updated the <i>v_position</i> by adding
      <i>v_normal * h(u, v) * height_scaling</i> to change the geometry.
    </p>
    <p>For part 5.5, we implemented environment mapped reflections. We found the outgoing eye-ray <i>wo</i> by getting
      the vector between the <i>v_position</i> and <i>u_cam_position</i> and dividing it by the length of <i>v_position
        - u_cam_position</i>. We then reflected <i>wo</i> by <i>v_normal</i> to get <i>wi</i>. We finally sampled
      <i>wi</i> using <i>u_texture_cubemap</i> and set that to the <i>out_color</i>.
    </p>

    <p>A shader program takes in both a vertex shader and fragment shader. The shader program gives inputs to the vertex
      shader and the outputs of that will be inputted as the inputs to the fragment shader. The vertex shader applies
      transforms to the vertices by changing their positions and normal vectors. It then updates the <i>gl_Position</i>.
      The fragment shader then takes the fragments that result after rasterization and shades them by setting the
      <i>out_color</i>.
    </p>

    <p>Blinn Phong shading combines ambient light, diffuse shading, and specular reflection to get the final shading.
      Each of these components are multiplied by their respective shading coefficients. Blinn Phong takes all of this
      into account to show a nice image that takes physics of light into consideration.

    <h2 align="middle">Extra Credit: Custom Shader</h2>
    <p>We created a custom shader by combining the bump shader and mirror shader. We took the code from bump mapping and
      got the normal <i>nd</i> and used that to reflect <i>wo</i> to get <i>wi</i>. We then sampled from the
      <i>u_texture_cubemap</i> to get the <i>out_color</i>. We combined the code from bump mapping and mirror shader to
      get this new shader that is a combination of the two where we see the bumps and reflections.
