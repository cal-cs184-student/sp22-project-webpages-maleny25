    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project we implemented Castelja's algorithm, Bezier surfaces, area weighted normal vectors, and loop
      subdivision in order to smooth out rendered objects. In the end, it was really satisfying to be able to see the
      objects become smoother as they performed such operations on them. I learned that most objects can really just be
      represented by halfedges and that manipulating flips and splits can take you a long way.

    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
    <p>
      Casteljau's algorithm takes a line with at least three points and creates new points using linear interpolation
      (lerps) on each edge and does this recursively until we're left with one point in the middle. This final point
      falls on the bezier curve. We implemented this by first creating a temporary 2D vector, which is meant to store
      the previous point, and a 2D vector to return. We iterate through each control point and interpolate it with the
      previous point with parameter <i>t</i>, and store the resulting point in the 2D vector to return. We then return
      the vector used to store the interpolated points.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
    <p>
      Casteljau's algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces because we extend it to a 3D space by adding variable z and using
      a n x n grid of control points. First, we implement <i>evaluateStep</i>, which is Casteljau's algorithm but with
      the addition of a z coordinate. Next, we implement <i>evaluate1D</i>, which repeatedly calls <i>evaluateStep</i>
      with parameter <i>t</i> on a given vector of points until one point is left. Lastly, we implement <i>evaluate</i>,
      which calls <i>evaluate1D</i> with parameter <i>u</i> on every row within the nxn grid of control points. It
      stores the resulting points in a vector and then calls <i>evaulate1D</i> with parameter <i>v</i> on the resulting
      vector to get our final interpolated vector.

    <h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
    <p>
      We implemented this by iterating through all of the neighboring halfedges and adding the normal of each
      neighboring face (the cross product of the current neighboring vertex position minus the original vertex position
      and the next neighboring vertex position minus the original vertex position) to a summation vector. After
      iterating through all of the neighboring halfedges, we return the normalized vector of the summation of all the
      cross products.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
    <p>
      We implemented edge flips by first having a check to see if the edge was a boundary, which meant that it couldn't
      be flipped and we returned an empty EdgeIter. We then grabbed all of the edges, halfedges, vertices, and faces to
      be able to know what is supposed to be flipped. Using a picture of a triangle with everything named, we then
      reassigned everything to ensure that every halfedge, edge, vertex, and face had the correct components. We
      debugged by checking to see if the right part was assigned to the right spot in the GUI. Later on in part 6, we
      caught a bug in part 4 where we assigned the outside halfedges to the wrong faces and it created a hole in the
      mesh later on.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
    <p>
      We implemented edge splits by first having a check to see if the edge was a boundary, which meant that it couldn't
      be flipped and we returned an empty EdgeIter. We then grabbed all of the halfedges, vertexes, edges and faces to
      be able to reassign them later. We then created new halfedges, faces, edges, and a vertex to account for the
      split. Using all this information that we have, we used a diagram to assign the right parts after the split and
      made sure to give the newly created components the right assignments that each needed. We also set up a
      newPosition to use in part 6 and isNew on the newly created components. Our split edge worked alone but when we
      were debugging we saw that faces disappeared when we flipped and split. We had to go through our code to ensure
      everything was assigned correctly. We then figured out that our flip edge was assigning the wrong faces which
      created the holes in the mesh

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
    <p>
      We implemented upsampling by first going through all of the vertices and edges and marking their <i>isNew</i>
      attribute to false. This ensured that we started a mesh that had no new components. We then iterated through all
      of the edges in the mesh and set the new positions attribute of each edge to be the new vertices created after the
      edge is split. Then we iterated through all the vertices in the mesh and set their new position attributes
      according to their degree and the positions of their neighboring vertices. . We then went through our edges and
      split them only if their vertices were old to ensure we only split old edges. After splitting, we iterated through
      every edge again and flipped edges only if they were connected to a new vertex and an old vertex and if the edge
      was new (we also modified <i>edgeSplit</i> so that the <i>isNew</i> attributes of new vertices and edges are set
      to true). Finally, we set all the vertex positions to the position stored in the new position attirbute. To debug,
      we would isolate different parts of our upsampling code to make sure each part was working correctly so we could
      tackle smaller problems rather than tackling all the issues at once. For example, we were able to determine that
      our previous method for finding the new positions of the new vertices was incorrect by only updating the positions
      of the new vertices and then realizing that it made our output asymmetrical.

    </p>

    <p>
      After loop division, meshes lose their sharp edges and corners gradually. The blockiness is lost especially in the
      cube we used which takes on a rounder shape the more you subdivide it. Pre-splitting does help to get a sharper
      image. Since there are more edges to split, the shape stays more similar by losing less of its structure as you
      subdivide it. Adding some splits and flips to the cube so that the edges of each face is symmetrical helps make
      the mesh stay symmetrical as you upsample.
